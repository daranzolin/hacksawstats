# hacksawstats

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of hacksawstats is to do simple stats quicker.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hacksawstats from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("daranzolin/hacksawstats")
```

## Example

The `%@%` operator is identical to `%>%` and is used only to alert the user to different behavior within the `*_split` functions (the piped object is recycled).

```{r example}
library(hacksawstats)
library(infer)

gss %@% 
  t_test_split(
    hours ~ college,
    hours ~ sex
  )

mtcars %@% 
  lm_split(
    model1 = mpg ~ wt,
    model2 = mpg ~ wt + hp
  )
```
